              <h2>About SpendPlan</h2>
	      <p>
		SpendPlan helps you keep track of your finances.  It's kind of like Mint, Quicken, 
		Microsoft Money, your "Family Finances" spreadsheet, or your checkbook ledger, 
		except SpendPlan is better.  SpendPlan uses your Dropbox account, which means:
	      </p>
	      <ol>
		<li>
		  Your records sync automatically and immediately between devices.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Your records are private; you're the only person who has access to them&ndash;
		  no advertisements.  (Technically speaking, Dropbox has access to your records.)
		</li>
	      </ol>
	      <h2>How It Works</h2>
	      <ol>
		<li>
		  Add your accounts&ndash;bank accounts, credit cards, etc.  It's a
		  good idea to make account names unique, so you don't get confused later on.
		  Make sure to choose a currency for each account; US Dollars is the default, 
		  but GB Pounds Sterling is also supported.  For GBP accounts, currency conversions 
		  are shown using the end-of-day rate for the date of the transaction; when a transaction
		  involves exchanging currency, this shows whether you got a good rate.  If you would like 
		  support for additional currencies, please 
		  <a href="mailto:rothlmar@gmail.com?subject=SpendPlan%20Currency%20Support">contact the developer</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Add transactions, just as they show up on your online banking or paper 
		  account statement.  A category is required, e.g. <strong>Groceries</strong>, 
		  <strong>Entertainment</strong>, or <strong>Travel</strong>. Tags are optional, 
		  if you use them, they're usually more specific than a category, e.g. <em>Christmas</em> 
		  or <em>Birthday</em> in the <strong>Gifts</strong> category.   You can add multiple 
		  tags as comma-separated list.
		</li>
		<li>
		  You can add transactions in bulk by uploading a CSV file.  Usually, this would be a file
		  that you download or export from your bank or financial institution.  Click on the "Choose File"
		  or "Upload from Dropbox" button, then follow your nose.
		  <ul>
		    <li>Select an account.</li>
		    <li>Indicate the format for the date (e.g. mm/dd/yy is 07/04/1776).</li>
		    <li>Choose column headers.  For some accounts, "Credit" and "Debit" will be listed in separate columns,
		      but most accounts have both in the same column, so choose "Amount".  If debits show up as positive, as they
		      might on a credit card, check the "Invert Amounts" box.  Finally, it's okay to select more than one column for "Note".
		    </li>
		    <li>Delete any superfluous rows, including column headers, by clicking the 
		      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> for that row.
		    </li>
		    <li>Click <a class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">Save</a>.  If you've made a mistake, nothing will happen, 
		      so go back and check everything.
		    </li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		  After you've added a transaction, you can change the category, tags, or description; just 
		  double click on the thing you want to change.  The date, amount, and account can't be
		  changed.  If you've made a mistake in one of those, delete the transaction and re-enter it.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Filters help you gain insight into your past behavior.  The transaction filters can show
		  you all of your transactions in a given category or at a given store (assuming you put that
		  in the note), and the date filters under <strong>Categories</strong> show how
		  much you earned spent over a specified time period.  The date filter in 
		  <strong>Accounts</strong> will eventually show you your account balance on the selected
		  date, but hasn't yet been set up.  Likewise with transaction filtering by tags.
		</li>
	      </ol>
	      <h2>How It's Different</h2>
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  In SpendPlan there's no distinction between account types.  You can make your own 
		  decisions about how to set things up, but I recommend that all expenditures be registered
		  as negative numbers.  That's not how they look on your credit card statement, which
		  is a sneaky trick the credit card companies use to make you think spending a lot of
		  money is good!
		</li>
		<li>
		  SpendPlan doesn't treat money transferred from one account to another specially.  When you 
		  pay a credit card from your checking account, you have to enter two transactions; one as
		  a debit, the other as a credit.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      <h2>Where It's Going</h2>
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  SpendPlan should live up to its promise of helping you plan your spending.  It isn't
		  quite there yet.  I have a vision of being able to set goals or targets, which would
		  be tied to tags and categories.  They could be ongoing, e.g. monthly grocery budget, or
		  time-limited, e.g. this year's Christmas budget.  I haven't yet finalized my vision of
		  how this will work; stay tuned.
		</li>
		<li>
		  SpendPlan is in active development.  If you're reading this, you're an alpha tester, 
		  so you know that some things don't work the way you expect, or at all. Please request 
		  any features that would be helpful to you.
